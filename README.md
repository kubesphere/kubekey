# KubeKey

Since v3.0, [KubeSphere](https://kubesphere.io) changes the ansible-based installer to the new installer called KubeKey that is developed in Go language. With KubeKey, you can install Kubernetes and KubeSphere separately or as a whole easily, efficiently and flexibly.

There are three scenarios to use KubeKey.

* Install Kubernetes only
* Install Kubernetes and KubeSphere together in one command
* Install Kubernetes first, then deploy KubeSphere on it using [ks-installer](https://github.com/kubesphere/ks-installer)

## Motivation

* Ansible-based installer has a bunch of software dependency such as Python. KubeKey is developed in Go language to get rid of the problem in a variety of environment so that increasing the success rate of installation.
* KubeKey uses Kubeadm to install K8s cluster on nodes in parallel as much as possible in order to reduce installation complexity and improve efficiency. It will greatly save installation time compared to the older installer.
* KubeKey supports for scaling cluster from allinone to multi-node cluster.
* KubeKey aims to install cluster as an object, i.e., CaaO.

## Supported Environment

### Linux Distributions

* **Ubuntu**  *16.04, 18.04*
* **Debian**  *Buster, Stretch*
* **CentOS/RHEL**  *7*

### Kubernetes Versions

* **v1.15**: &ensp; *v1.15.12*
* **v1.16**: &ensp; *v1.16.10*
* **v1.17**: &ensp; *v1.17.6* (default)
* **v1.18**: &ensp; *v1.18.3*

## Requirements and Recommendations

* Minimum resource requirements (For Minimal Installation of KubeSphere only)：
  * 2 vCPUs
  * 4 GB RAM
  * 20 GB Storage

> /var/lib/docker is mainly used to store the container data, and will gradually increase in size during use and operation. In the case of a production environment, it is recommended that /var/lib/docker mounts a drive separately.

* OS requirements:
  * `SSH` can access to all nodes.
  * Time synchronization for all nodes.
  * `sudo`/`curl`/`openssl` can be used in all nodes.
  * `ebtables`/`socat`/`ipset`/`conntrack` should be installed in all nodes.
  * The [relevant client](./docs/storage-client.md) should be installed in all nodes, if NFS / Ceph / GlusterFS is used as persistent storage.
  * `docker` can be installed by yourself or by KubeKey. 
  
> It's recommended that Your OS is clean (without any other software installed), otherwise there may be conflicts.  
> A container image mirror (accelerator) is recommended to be prepared, if you have trouble downloading images from dockerhub.io.

* Networking and DNS requirements:
  * Make sure the DNS address in /etc/resolv.conf is available. Otherwise, it may cause some issues of DNS in cluster.
  * If your network configuration uses Firewall or Security Group，you must ensure infrastructure components can communicate with each other through specific ports. It's recommended that you turn off the firewall or follow the link configuriation: [NetworkAccess](./docs/network-access.md).

## Usage

### Get the Installer Excutable File

* Download Binary

    ```shell script
    curl -O -k https://kubernetes.pek3b.qingstor.com/tools/kubekey/kk
    chmod +x kk
    ```

or

* Build Binary from Source Code

    ```shell script
    git clone https://github.com/kubesphere/kubekey.git
    cd kubekey
    ./build.sh
    ```

> Note:
>
> * Docker needs to be installed before building.
> * If you have problem to access `https://proxy.golang.org/` in China mainland, excute `build.sh -p` instead.

### Create a Cluster

#### quick start

Quick Start is for allinone installation which is a good start to get familiar with KubeSphere.

##### command

```shell script
./kk create cluster [--with-kubernetes version] [--with-kubesphere version]
```

##### examples

* Create a pure Kubernetes cluster with default version.

    ```shell script
    ./kk create cluster
    ```

* Create a Kubernetes cluster with a specified version ([supported versions](#Kubernetes Versions))

    ```shell script
    ./kk create cluster --with-kubernetes v1.17.6
    ```

* Create a Kubernetes cluster with KubeSphere installed

    ```shell script
    ./kk create cluster --with-kubesphere [version]
    ```

#### Advanced

You have more control to customize parameters or create a multi-node cluster using the advanced installation. Specifically, create a cluster by specifying a configuration file.

1. First, create an example configuration file

    ```shell script
    ./kk create config [--with-kubernetes version] [--with-storage plugins] [--with-kubesphere version] [(-f | --file) path]
    ```

   **examples:**

   * create an example config file with default configurations. You also can specify the file that could be a different filename, or in different folder.

    ```shell script
    ./kk create config [-f ~/myfolder/abc.yaml]
    ```

   * with storage plugins (supported: localVolume, nfsClient, rbd, glusterfs). You can specify multiple plugins separated by comma. Please note the first one you add will be the default storage class.

    ```shell script
    ./kk create config --with-storage localVolume
    ```

   * with KubeSphere

    ```shell script
    ./kk create config --with-kubesphere
    ```

2. Modify the file config-sample.yaml according to your environment
3. Create a cluster using the configuration file

    ```shell script
    ./kk create cluster -f config-sample.yaml
    ```

### Add Nodes

Add new node's information to the cluster config file, then apply the changes.

```shell script
./kk scale -f config-sample.yaml
```

### Delete Cluster

You can delete the cluster by the following command

```shell script
./kk delete cluster [-f config-sample.yaml]
```

### Enable kubectl autocompletion

KubeKey doesn't enable kubectl autocompletion. Refer to the guide below and turn it on:

**Prerequisite**: make sure bash-autocompletion is installed and works.

```shell script
# Install bash-completion
$ apt-get install bash-completion

# Source the completion script in your ~/.bashrc file
$ echo 'source <(kubectl completion bash)' >>~/.bashrc

# Add the completion script to the /etc/bash_completion.d directory
$ kubectl completion bash >/etc/bash_completion.d/kubectl
```

More detail reference could be found [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#enabling-shell-autocompletion).
