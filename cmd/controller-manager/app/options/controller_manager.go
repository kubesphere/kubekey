	// LeaderElectionResourceLock determines which resource lock to use for leader election,
	// defaults to "leases". Change this value only if you know what you are doing.
	//
	// If you are using `configmaps`/`endpoints` resource lock and want to migrate to "leases",
	// you might do so by migrating to the respective multilock first ("configmapsleases" or "endpointsleases"),
	// which will acquire a leader lock on both resources.
	// After all your users have migrated to the multilock, you can go ahead and migrate to "leases".
	// Please also keep in mind, that users might skip versions of your controller.
	//
	// Note: before controller-runtime version v0.7, it was set to "configmaps".
	// And from v0.7 to v0.11, the default was "configmapsleases", which was
	// used to migrate from configmaps to leases.
	// Since the default was "configmapsleases" for over a year, spanning five minor releases,
	// any actively maintained operators are very likely to have a released version that uses
	// "configmapsleases". Therefore defaulting to "leases" should be safe since v0.12.
	//
	// So, what do you have to do when you are updating your controller-runtime dependency
	// from a lower version to v0.12 or newer?
	// - If your operator matches at least one of these conditions:
	//   - the LeaderElectionResourceLock in your operator has already been explicitly set to "leases"
	//   - the old controller-runtime version is between v0.7.0 and v0.11.x and the
	//     LeaderElectionResourceLock wasn't set or was set to "leases"/"configmapsleases"/"endpointsleases"
	//   feel free to update controller-runtime to v0.12 or newer.
	// - Otherwise, you may have to take these steps:
	//   1. update controller-runtime to v0.12 or newer in your go.mod
	//   2. set LeaderElectionResourceLock to "configmapsleases" (or "endpointsleases")
	//   3. package your operator and upgrade it in all your clusters
	//   4. only if you have finished 3, you can remove the LeaderElectionResourceLock to use the default "leases"
	// Otherwise, your operator might end up with multiple running instances that
	// each acquired leadership through different resource locks during upgrades and thus
	// act on the same resources concurrently.
